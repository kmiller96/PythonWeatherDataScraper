    "Data is the oil of our information age. With it we can save lives, be more efficient and make more money. Data isn't just plucked from the internet in well organised, coherent files. The raw data needs to be *extracted*! That's what is happening here. **This project is about extracting information about the weather in Western Australia** using the Bureau of Meteorology's raw data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The end result of this data extraction will be a single CSV file with weather data about the rainfall, temperature and solar exposure of each weather station in WA. This will be done using a single Python executable (.py): this [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook is only a proof of concept. Instead of collecting all of the data here in the notebook it will instead serve as an insight into my thought process. As such, I'll only be collecting rainfall data for a couple weather stations. \n",

    "All of the processes being used can be extended to gather data near-automatically in any (or all) states and territories in Australia. If you wish to collect data in your own country or region then this document can serve as guidlines as to how to solve similar problems you'll face.\n",

    "If you haven't figured it out so far, I'll be using [Python](https://www.python.org/) to extract my data. Python is a loosely-typed, object-orientated programming language built in C. A hugely beneficial feature of Python is its use of packages. In this projcet I'll be mainly using [urllib2](https://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib2.html), [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) plus help from some smaller packages like [zipfile](https://docs.python.org/2/library/zipfile.html) and [glob](https://docs.python.org/2/library/glob.html).
